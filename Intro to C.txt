# C is the lowest level portable language thats why OS and 
many things written in C
# We can reach machine code
# Below C we have assembly language like for MC 8051.
# Compiler converts the instructions set to machine code so that CPU understand.
# Here We Use MinGW Compiler

Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a 
time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and 
translates the whole of it into machine code at once.
